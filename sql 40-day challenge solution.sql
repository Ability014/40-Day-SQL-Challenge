/*
Is there anything wrong with the SQL statement below?

SELECT customer_id, sum(amount) revenue
FROM customer_tranx
GROUP BY customer_id
WHERE sum(amount) > 20000;
*/
--1. WHERE clause should be used before a GROUP BY
--2. Aggregate functions shouldn't be used in a WHERE clause

-- Q32.
/*
Given that an employee table has details of about 50 employees with an ID ranging from 1 - 50, what is the appropriate operator in the query below to select details of all 
employees whose salary is above all employees with an ID above 40?

SELECT *

FROM EMPLOYEES E1

WHERE SALARY _____ (SELECT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES E2 WHERE ID > 40);
*/
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES E1
WHERE SALARY >ALL (SELECT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES E2 WHERE ID > 40);

-- Q33.
/*
Is this query valid? If yes, what is the behaviour?

SELECT first_name, last_name, SALARY/(SELECT SUM(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES) 
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY/(SELECT SUM(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES) > 0.005;
*/
--Yes, the query is valid. It returns details of employees whose salary is above 0.5% of all employees salaries.

/*
Given a table cust_tranx with 1,000,000 records, what is the result/behaviour of the query below 
and why?

SELECT SUM(1)
FROM cust_tranx;
*/
--The query returns 1,000,000. It sums 1 as a scalar value in 1 million places.

-- Q35.
/*
What is the behavior of the UPDATE statement below?

UPDATE EMPLOYEES
SET SALARY = (CASE WHEN ID > 3 THEN SALARY*2 END);
*/
--The query doubles the salary of employees with ID greater than 3 while the other employee salaries is replaced with NULL

-- Q36.
/*
What is the behavior of this query?

SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN SALARY > 300000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
FROM EMPLOYEES;
*/
--This query is trying to check if there is any employee with salary above 300,000

-- Q37.
/*
What is the result of the query below?

SELECT NAME, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES
HAVING SALARY > 10000;
*/
--The query throws an error as the salary column is neither an aggregate or in a GROUP BY clause. A WHERE clause is appropriate in this case.

-- Q38.
/*
Given table TRANX having 50000 records, what is the result of the query below?

SELECT 2*COUNT(2), 2*SUM(2) FROM TRANX;
*/
--2*COUNT(2) = 2*50000 = 100000
--2*SUM(2) = 2*50000*2 = 200000

/*
Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.

Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.

Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. 
The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.
